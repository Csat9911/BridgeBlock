# BridgeBlock

# Story Behind the App

  <li> This app was created for the town of Point Pleasant. Point Pleasant has 3 main draw bridges that will raise and lower all year round both on and off of a schedule. The problem with this is it can cause traffic delays and can be very inconvient if you are not expecting the bridges to be up.
  
  <li> Bridge Block was an app to help solve this problem. It gives live feed updates to the user to alert them when the bridge will be going up and at what location
  
  <li> The circles on the map show exactly which Bridge will be affected. Similar to a stop light, green means the bridge is down and the user should not expect traffic delays. Red means the bridge is up and alerts the user to avoid this route at all costs.
  
  <li> A newer update alerts the user of train delays, trains can also cause unexpected delays when arriving to station.
  
  <li> There is also a website that the bridge operators use to punch in times of raise/lowers.
